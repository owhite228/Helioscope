                <h3>So what is a sun sign?</h3>
                <p>Your sun sign is what directs the rest of your star chart. It represents your conscious mind, your will, and your creativity.
                    Our life purpose is derived from our sun signs, as well as our egos.</p>
                <p>Your sun is your basic identity.</p>
                <P>The sun moves into a sign of the zodiac every month, so your sun sign is determined by the month and day you were born.</p>
